## **Aim**
To develop a **prompt-based application** using ChatGPT that can help users organize daily tasks, manage time efficiently, and improve productivity.  
This experiment aims to demonstrate how **prompt engineering** evolves from simple to advanced designs to achieve more accurate, structured, and human-like outputs from large language models (LLMs).

---

## **Explanation**
A prompt-based application interacts with the user using natural language.  
It uses **carefully designed prompts** to guide the LLM (ChatGPT) to perform useful functions such as:

- Managing and prioritizing daily tasks  
- Scheduling meetings or reminders  
- Providing health and wellness suggestions  
- Adapting responses based on user preferences  
- Handling general knowledge queries  

The experiment showcases how **progressive prompt design** (from simple to advanced) improves response accuracy, structure, and contextual understanding.  
This forms the foundation for building intelligent, personalized AI applications.

---

## **Prompt**
“Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.  
The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

---

## **Procedure**

### **1. Define the Objective**
Identify what the AI assistant should be capable of:
- Understanding user inputs in plain language  
- Creating and managing to-do lists  
- Suggesting schedules and wellness activities  
- Adapting to the user’s habits and feedback  
- Responding conversationally and naturally  

---

### **2. Designing the Prompts**
Construct prompts for various functionalities, starting simple and becoming more descriptive, role-based, and structured.

#### **Example 1 – Daily Task Organizer**
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  `List my tasks for today.`  
- **Intermediate Prompt:**  
  `Make a timetable for my day, including study time, meals, and breaks.`  
- **Advanced Prompt:**  
  `You are my AI productivity planner. Organize my day into focused work sessions, breaks, and self-care activities. Include motivational notes and mark tasks by priority.`  

---

#### **Example 2 – Smart Scheduler**
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  `Schedule a meeting at 3 PM.`  
- **Intermediate Prompt:**  
  `Add a meeting at 3 PM and remind me 15 minutes earlier.`  
- **Advanced Prompt:**  
  `You are an intelligent scheduler. Find the best 30-minute slot tomorrow for a team meeting, considering my free time between 10 AM and 4 PM. Also, check for any overlapping tasks.`  

---

#### **Example 3 – Wellness Tips**
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  `Give me a wellness tip.`  
- **Intermediate Prompt:**  
  `Suggest one wellness activity for a student with a long study schedule.`  
- **Advanced Prompt:**  
  `As my virtual wellness coach, provide three personalized tips for managing screen time, staying hydrated, and improving posture during long study sessions.`  

---

### **3. Simulate User Interaction**
Create a simulated chat or command-line interface.  
Users can type instructions like:
- “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”  
- “Plan my study schedule for tomorrow.”  
- “Give me wellness advice for a stressful day.”  

The model responds with structured and context-aware outputs, just like a personal assistant.

---

### **4. Collect User Feedback and Adapt**
The assistant refines its behavior by understanding user preferences over time, for example:
- Preferring short task summaries  
- Giving motivational quotes every morning  
- Adjusting reminders to preferred times (morning, afternoon, or evening)

This step simulates the concept of **adaptive personalization**.

---

### **5. Integrate Memory (Optional)**
A simple memory layer can be implemented to store user details such as:
- Usual wake-up time  
- Favorite activities  
- Common task types  
This helps the assistant give consistent and context-based replies, simulating long-term learning.

---

## **Expected Output**

### **Sample Output Generated by ChatGPT**

**Personal Productivity Assistant Features:**

1. **Daily Task Manager**
   - Add and track daily activities.  
   - Organize tasks by priority, importance, or deadline.  
   - Give reminders like: *“Don’t forget your assignment submission at 6 PM.”*  
   - Provide a daily or weekly summary of completed and pending tasks.  

2. **Smart Scheduler**
   - Automatically identify the best available time slots for new events.  
   - Detect scheduling conflicts and suggest alternate timings.  
   - Send reminders and motivational updates before key activities.  

3. **Wellness Advisor**

     - *“Drink a glass of water every hour.”*  
     - *“Take a 10-minute walk to refresh your mind.”*  
   - Adapt advice based on user lifestyle and frequency of breaks.  

4. **Knowledge Query Assistant**
   - Respond to general questions like *“What’s the best time to study?”* or *“Give me tips to improve focus.”*  
   - Provide concise, informative, and motivating answers.
